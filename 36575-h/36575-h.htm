<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>
<p>
This tragedy was brought upon the stage in 1780; it was extremely
admired, and exceedingly attractive.
</p>
<p>
Neither "The Winter's Tale", nor "Henry VIII" by Shakspeare, were at
that time performed at either of the theatres; and the town had no
immediate comparison to draw between the conjugal incidents in "The
Count of Narbonne," and those which occur in these two very superior
dramas.
</p>
<p>
The Cardinal Wolsey of Shakspeare, is, by Jephson, changed into a holy
and virtuous priest; but his importance is, perhaps, somewhat diminished
by a discovery, which was intended to heighten the interest of his
character; but which is introduced in too sudden, and romantic a manner,
to produce the desired consequence upon a well-judging auditor.
</p>
<p>
One of the greatest faults, by which a dramatist can disappoint and
fret his auditor, is also to be met with in this play.&mdash;Infinite
discourse is exchanged, numberless plans formed, and variety of
passions agitated, concerning a person, who is never brought upon the
stage&mdash;Such is the personal nonentity of Isabel, in this tragedy, and
yet the fable could not proceed without her.&mdash;Alphonso, so much talked
of, yet never seen, is an allowable absentee, having departed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

 to another
world; and yet, whether such invisible personages be described as
alive, or dead, that play is the most interesting, which makes mention
of no one character, but those which are introduced to the sight of the
audience.
</p>
<p>
The lover of romances, whose happy memory, unclouded by more weighty
recollections, has retained a wonderful story, by the late Lord Orford,
called, "The Castle of Otranto," will here, it is said, find a resemblance
of plot and incidents, the acknowledged effect of close imitation.
</p>
<p>
Lord Orford, (at that time Mr. Horace Walpole,) attended some rehearsals
of this tragedy, upon the very account, that himself was the founder of
the fabric.
</p>
<p>
The author was of no mean reputation in the literary world, for he had
already produced several successful dramas. "The Count of Narbonne"
proved to be his last, and his best composition.&mdash;&mdash;Terror is here ably
excited by descriptions of the preternatural&mdash;Horror, by the portraiture
of guilt; and compassion, by the view of suffering innocence.&mdash;These are
three passions, which, divided, might each constitute a tragedy; and all
these powerful engines of the mind and heart, are here, most happily
combined to produce that end,&mdash;and each forms a lesson of morality.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
